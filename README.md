# Fancy asterisk playground
Just a little side project
## Installation
1. bundle install
2. bundle exec librarian-puppet install
3. vagrant up
## Description
Since I do have a little spare time I though I will start a new project involving
provisioning of asterisk pbx server running on Centos 7. Since i will need coupke
custom rpms I also included a jenkins and server.

Perhaps ill try to run this on AWS someday :)
