# ${1:Fancy asterisk playground}
Just a little side project
## Installation
bundle install
bundle exec librarian-puppet install
vagrant up
## Description
Since I do have a little spare time I though I will start a new project involving
provisioning of asterisk pbx server running on Centos 7. Since i will need coupke
custom rpms I also included a jenkins and server.

Perhaps ill try to run this on AWS someday :)
